Around for decades, recently the WSOP recently made its biggest gamble ever, one that turned out to be a million dollar winner.</p><p>Since the poker boom of 2003, the WSOP gradually added events to its calendar, which also expanded into November with a live telecast of the WSOP Main Event. The tournament even added a $1 million event for the best, and richest, players on the planet.</p><p>So what's bigger than a million dollar tournament? <strong>The Colossus</strong>. This isn't a cyborg or plot to a new sci-fi movie. It was a <strong>$565 No-Limit Hold'em</strong> event. This is the smallest entry fee this millennium for the WSOP. It was also the riskiest.</p><p>The goal was simple: create the largest live poker tournament ever. To entice interest, the WSOP guaranteed a <strong>$5 million</strong> prize pool. The largest previous live tournament field was 8,773 entries in the 2006 WSOP Main Event.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-151578 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/poker.jpg alt="Ethan Miller/Getty Images" width=670 height=469 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-151578 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><p>Talk about a gamble. Let's assume the event broke the record by one person. It would have generated $4,957,310 in fees. The WSOP would have lost $40,000, which doesn't mean much to a facility. That doesn't include the cost of operating the tournament or that space that could have been used for other events. Barely breaking the record would have been a financial fold; anything less could have been a bust.</p><p>As with all gambling, with the risk comes a reward. For a sport that has lost its luster with Black Friday, more online play and a steady decline in tournament entries at select tournaments, the Colossus brought poker mainstream media attention. It also brought accessibility to the WSOP, where many events have entries fees of $2,500 or higher. For casual players who always wanted to enter a WSOP event, this was a chance to say they could do it without breaking the bank.</p><p>The gamble payed out, and then some. The tournament broke a record with <strong>14,824 entrants</strong>. Because of the tournament structure, players who busted out early were allowed to reenter. As result, the final field was <strong>22,734</strong>. At $565 a pop, that's <strong>$12,844,710</strong> in entry fees. The prize pool finished&nbsp;at <strong>$11,187,000</strong>. More than 2,200 people ended up making money. The smallest payout was nearly $1,100. Lance Garcia had a slightly better day. He outlasted 22,733 entries to win the first ever Colossus and the more than $600,000 (and fancy bracelet) that comes with winning the tournament. That left nearly <strong>$1 million</strong> for the WSOP organizers, not to mention the free publicity and money spent in Vegas during the tournament.</p><p>For something that could have been a colossal bust, the Colossus proved to be a major boost to a sport looking for its next boom. And at $565 an entry, it makes the perfect gift for the poker fan in your life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJorqiqnJl6tLHRopysZaCkuKa%2BjKaYnZ1danqutculoKimXZyurq7LnmSwp55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
