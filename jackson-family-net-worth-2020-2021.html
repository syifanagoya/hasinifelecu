Janet was also inducted in 2019.</p><p>The third generation of the family is made up of 26 children, some of whom have followed in the footsteps of their parents. The most known of these children are Michael’s children, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, and Prince Michael Jackson. These kids became more famous after the death of their father, Michael Jackson, in 2009.</p><p>The three sons of Tito are the members of the R&B/Pop music group by the name of 3T.
