Many of the players had day jobs in the neighborhood, and many of them lived in boarding houses near the stadium, per <a href=#>Billy Penn</a>. They hung out at the YMCA and played football with neighborhood kids. The team had a band and a fight song, as well as cheerleaders and a mascot. And after covering expenses, the organization donated any further profits to local charities.</p><p dir=ltr>For all the strong organizational infrastructure and local support in the community, the Frankford Yellow Jackets were struggling by the early 1930s. <a href=#>The Great Depression</a> hit the Yellow Jackets from just about every angle imaginable, per <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>. The nearby textile mills shut down, which meant fans — and some players — lost their day jobs. As a result, ticket and concession sales were down. The team couldn't attract veteran players without a significant salary offering. Frankford Stadium, which was damaged in a fire in 1929, was finished off in a larger fire in 1931.</p><p dir=ltr>Soon, the Frankford Yellow Jackets were forced to become a traveling team in 1931 with no home field. After racking up a 1-6-1 record to start the season, the morale of the Yellow Jackets was decidedly low. One final blow — a 13 to 0 loss to the New York Giants on November 8, 1931 — led the Yellow Jackets to suspend operations, per the <a href=#>Free Library of Philadelphia</a>. They never recovered and declared bankruptcy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHJrbG1pZMGpsYybmKejoqq9tXnNn6NmrJWWum7Ax5qrZqSVmXq1u4ytn55lk6eyosDIqKVmp5ZiwamxjKmfoqSRmbKtvMeimGadkZy5pr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
