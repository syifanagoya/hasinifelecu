Karlie has also appeared on the show Scream Queens 2, and is a talented dancer and cover model with several magazine covers in her portfolio.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>She was born Keisha Lewis in New York City on April 15. Her birth year is a hot topic of debate, explained later in this article. Redd's mother hails from Trinidad.

She attended The Harlem School of the Arts and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. By the age of 16, Redd had booked over 40 gigs as a model in print and on television.

She was billed as Keisha "Karlie" Lewis. That same year, Redd earned further popularity after she was cast in the VH1 reality show "Scream Queens." Ten years later, Redd earned further popularity after she appeared in the spin-off reality show "Love & Hop Hop: Atlanta" on VH1. On the show, Keisha dated hip-hop artists <a href=# title="Benzino Net Worth">Benzino</a> and <a href=# title="Yung Joc Net Worth">Yung Joc</a>. When a language analytics company ran an analysis of the show, it showed that Karlie's appearances on the fifth season of the show garnered "16 percent of emotional reactions about the show collected from social media data, with the largest share of them negative." Suffice it to say, Karlie was not a popular cast member. For her work on "Love & Hip Hop" she earns $40,000 per episode. Over the first 9 years that the show was on, she appeared in 22 episodes. That works out to around $880,000 in pre-tax earnings.</p><p>Redd scored her first role in a box office film in 2014 when she appeared in <a href=# title="Chris Rock Net Worth">Chris Rock</a>'s "Top Five."&nbsp; She is also a recurring cast member on the Bounce TV show Saints & Sinners for which she earns $10,000 per episode.
