Once Upon a Time combined <a href=#>fairy tales</a> with reality for seven seasons — and fans are still hooked on the series.</p><p>The <a href=#>ABC drama premiered in October 2011</a> and showed viewers two worlds: Storybrooke (located in Maine) and the fairy tale realm.</p><p>After arriving in Storybooke with her son, Henry (<strong>Jared Gilmore</strong>), Emma Swan (<a href=#><strong>Jennifer Morrison</strong></a>) discovers that the townspeople are actually story book characters trapped in the real world by a curse.</p><p>Throughout the show, fans learned the characters’ true identities, including Emma’s biological parents Snow White (<a href=#><strong>Ginnifer Goodwin</strong></a>) and Prince Charming (<a href=#><strong>Josh Dallas</strong></a>).</p><p>The beloved fairy tale figures — which also include the Evil Queen (<a href=#><strong>Lana Parrilla</strong></a>) and Hook (<a href=#><strong>Colin O’Donoghue</strong></a>) — managed to overcome not one but five curses before the show ended in May 2018.</p><p>Many of the stars, however, exited the series at the end of season 6, which aired from 2016 to 2017. The final season served as a bit of a reboot and took place in Seattle’s fictitious neighborhood of Hyperion Heights with the narrator being adult Henry.</p><p>“I certainly hope that it’s part of the Disney legacy. The Disney legacy leans into this idea of if you dream it, you can do it,” Morrison told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in May 2018 after returning for a season 7 cameo. “But ultimately there is the possibility of very hopeful situations in life, and that you have to take responsibility for yourself in a way where you can have hope. You can have your own version of magic in life. I hope that we fit into that Disney idea and that ultimately part of its legacy leans into this same message.”</p><p>Dallas and Goodwin, for their part, <a href=#>have a different legacy after falling in love on the show</a>. The twosome, who played <a href=#>married fairy tale characters Prince Charming and Snow White</a>, tied the knot in April 2014 and have since welcomed two children.</p><p>The Five actor <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in January 2020 that <a href=#>he knew Goodwin was The One</a> “after the read-through or the pilot.” He added: “Yeah, it was pretty soon.”</p><p>Dallas recalled feeling “pretty confident” that he’d make a romantic connection with the <a href=#>Something Borrowed</a> actress. “Just look at her,” he said at the time. “Just look at Ginnifer Goodwin. Look at her mind and the way it works. It’s like, how could you not [fall in love]?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Walk the Line</a> star, for her part, called her husband a “knight in shining armor” <a href=#>while speaking to Us in April 2015</a>, noting how helpful he was while raising their kids.</p><p>Scoll down to see what the cast of Once Upon a Time is doing now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bku6SxjK6nqKZdlnq1tcyeZJyZo6l6uLTEq5xmmaKaerW0xLJkp6enZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
