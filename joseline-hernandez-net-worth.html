She became part of the cast of the first season of Love & Hip Hop Atlanta in 2012. She was Stevie J's new artist.

The following year, she starred in her own television special, Joseline's Special Delivery, which documented the birth of her child with Stevie J.</p><p>During the taping of the sixth season's reunion on June 1, 2017, Hernandez quit Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta amid escalating tensions with creator <a href=# title="Mona Scott-Young Net Worth">Mona Scott-Young</a> and the show's producers.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-301032 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Joseline-Hernandez.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-301032 class=wp-caption-text>Jemal Countess/Getty Images</p><p>In January 2018, news broke that Hernandez was involved with and filming a new reality show, Joseline Takes Miami. &nbsp;On March 4, 2019, it was reported that Joseline Takes Miami had hit production snags and that the network was requesting reshoots. The project never made it on the air.</p><p>In October 2019, Joseline signed a streaming deal to create, produce and star in her own reality show franchise. Joseline's Cabaret: Miami, premiered January 19, 2020. In May 2020, Joseline began casting for the second season of Joseline's Cabaret.</p><p>In December 2019, Joseline returned to the Love & Hip Hop franchise to join the cast of Love & Hip Hop: Miami for its third season, which premiered in early January 2020.</p><p>In February 2020, Joseline and her boyfriend Balistic Beats appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Hip Hop Edition. On the season finale of the show on April 9, Beats proposed to Hernandez in front of their fellow Marriage Boot Camp castmates.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Joseline Hernandez is bisexual.&nbsp;She has said that she likes men and women equally and that she does not have a stronger preference one way or another.</p><p>She's often called "The Puerto Rican Princess."</p><p>One of her brothers is autistic.</p><p>Hernandez and Stevie J claimed to have gotten married in 2013. However, three years later, Stevie J admitted that their marriage was faked for publicity. Later that same year, Joseline confirmed they were in a long term relationship but never legally married. Their breakup was featured on the fifth season of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.</p><p>During the filming of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta's fifth season reunion, Hernandez revealed she was pregnant with Stevie's sixth child. She gave birth to their daughter Bonnie Bella on December 28, 2016. Joseline and Stevie J have been embroiled in an ongoing custody dispute over their daughter Bonnie Bella.</p><p>In May of 2019, Stevie J alleged that Joseline hadn't allowed him to see or contact his daughter in over a month. He also mentioned in the legal filing that he feared for his daughter's safety and overall well-being. Stevie J suggested that Joseline was unfit to be a parent, and said that he is more financially stable and that his family with singer <a href=# title="Faith Evans Net Worth">Faith Evans</a> would be a better influence for his young daughter. He also demanded that Joseline pay child support. For what it's worth, before the custody drama, Joseline commented on social media that Stevie barely showed any interest in their child. The whole situation heated up in late July 2019 when Stevie J&nbsp;was scheduled to take custody of his daughter from July 28 to August 11.&nbsp;But when Stevie tried to go get her in Miami, Joseline flew off to Los Angeles with Bonnie Bella. A warrant for Joseline's arrest was issued until she agreed to turn the child over to her father.&nbsp;Joseline flew back Miami with her daughter and Bonnie Bella was given to Stevie's adult daughter. Stevie J was granted sole custody until their next court date on August 15, 2019.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-227838 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Joseline-Hernandez.jpg alt="joseline hernandez net worth" width=403 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-227838 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><p>In November 2019, Stevie J was granted primary custody of Bonnie Bella. Joseline was given visitation rights. The courts also ruled that Stevie J no longer had to pay her child support. Joseline learned this news while on Marriage Boot Camp: Hip Hop Edition. She had an onscreen breakdown and commented that she felt like her life was falling apart. Fortunately, this was a short-lived arrangement and&nbsp;Joseline was given temporary custody so that Bonnie Bella could continue attending school in her mom's home state of Florida. This arrangement, which still exempted Stevie J from child support remained in effect until February of 2020. As of this writing, the former couple are still battling it out in court.</p><p>Hernandez went public with her relationship with music producer Robin Ingouma, known professionally as Balistic Beats in April 2018. In 2020, Hernandez and Beats got engaged. Hernandez and Beats are scheduled to marry on December 25, 2020.</p><p>In early June 2020, Hernandez took to her Instagram account to send a word of encouragement out to the protesters out protesting police brutality against black people. She said: "I wanted to send everybody out there love and positivity. I've been doing a lot of praying. I've been praying for the United States of America, the whole wide world. The president to soften up his heart.&nbsp;That's daily routine every day. To pray for all the protesters. To pray for all the people that's out there fighting the everyday fight to make things change for all black children, for all the black community, the Hispanic community that are like myself, Afro Latinos.&nbsp;We love you guys stay safe out there. Just keep the prayers up. Just keep the prayers up, alright."</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2019, Hernandez was sued by the posh Miami apartment complex she rents for unpaid rent. Landlord Beach Place Apartments sued the reality star for $2,056 a month rent she failed to pay on her two-bedroom apartment. Beach Place Apartments said that it left a notice demanding the rent from her outside the apartment door, but she never paid up. She owed $2,375 as well as her landlord's lawyer fees. It was reported that Hernandez's landlord dropped their lawsuit against the reality star. Hernandez had yet to respond to the lawsuit in court when her landlords decided to drop the case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX5%2B8tLHLoqWeZZiav6%2BtzZ2cs2WemsFuw86rq6Fn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
