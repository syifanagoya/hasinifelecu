"Banging," wrote Kaz Crossley. "Obsessed with you," added Lucinda Strafford. How does the reality star stay so fit? Read on to see 5 ways Ellie Brown stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span>30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Ellie went on an extreme diet before appearing on Love Island, spending two-and-a-half hours a day in the gym for the two months. "I hired a personal trainer for weight training, then would spend the rest sweating away on the treadmill," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Sun</span></a><span>. "</span>A health coach is your personal health cheerleader, guide and partner. They help you implement lifestyle changes to improve your physical health," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Cleveland Clinic</a>. "The service is often available through corporate wellness programs. Your doctor may also recommend health coaching if you have a chronic health issue like diabetes. Or, you may hire a health coach to help you achieve a wellness goal like getting fit."</p><p><span>She also kept her diet clean, staying away from any sugar, dairy, or carbohydrates, eating white fish and vegetables "about five times a day," and eliminating fruit. "</span>If you're worried about your heart health, eating at least two servings of fish per week could reduce your risk of<span>&nbsp;</span><a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href=# data-di-id=di-id-4aa34cd4-cb2d704a>heart disease," says the Mayo Clinic. "</a>For many years, the American Heart Association has recommended that people eat fish rich in unsaturated fats at least twice a week. The unsaturated fats in fish are called omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation can damage your blood vessels, and lead to heart disease and<span>&nbsp;</span><a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href=# data-di-id=di-id-93cd9f39-6ddeb0e0>strokes</a>."<span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/shutterstock_1736947181.jpg><p><span>To lose weight, she also quit drinking for a whopping eight weeks. Since alcohol is high in calories anyone who is trying to lose weight should consider cutting down or eliminating it completely. "<span>Decide not to drink a day or two each week. You may want to abstain for a week or a month to see how you feel physically and emotionally without alcohol in your life. Taking a break from alcohol can be a good way to start drinking less," advises <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Harvard Health</a>.</span></span></p><p><span>Ellie couldn't stick to her drastic diet and exercise routine. "I looked amazing, but that diet really isn't sustainable. I'd end some days completely exhausted because my body wasn't getting all the nutrients it needed — and, of course, the meals became SO boring," she told The Sun. After the show she "put on a stone or so," and was body shamed by trolls but she is happier. "What the shamers need to realise is that there's a difference between someone who is unhealthy and overweight, and someone who's just a normal size," she told The Sun. "I'm perfectly fit and happy now — just as I was before Love Island."</span></p><p><span>Ellie is one of the many stars who swear by Barry's Bootcamp workouts, a high intensity interval training class conducted in a bootcamp like setting. There is lots of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Research</span></a><span> backing up the benefits of HIIT workouts, including body fat reduction, improved cardiovascular function, and mental health. It is also time effective.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxknqScnrJurtGorqdlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjJ6lo6epqHq1tMRmrp6dm5q7pXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
