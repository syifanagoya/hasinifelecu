The former reality star told The U.S.&nbsp;Sun that her kids will be teenagers before they're allowed to use sites like TikTok. "I feel as though maybe 16 ... with King, maybe 14, boys are different,"&nbsp;she said. Interestingly, Chyna's daughter often appears on the social media accounts of her aunts, especially on Khloe Kardashian's Instagram feed. Khloe is extremely close to Dream and, on an episode of "The Kardashians," Khloe called Dream "one of [her] babies" and said she feels like her "third parent,"&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=#>Page Six</a>. In the days that followed, some media outlets suggested that Khloe was shading Chyna with her comment, but she released a statement to clear the air.&nbsp;</p><p>"My brother and I are extremely close. I am with Dream all the time because I'm with my brother all of the time. I love her beyond measure,"&nbsp;she said on her Instagram Stories&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>). Chyna also responded to the controversy when <a href=#>TMZ</a> caught up with her — and she seems grateful that there are people in her life who love her kids. "Everything is good on both ends, we are all family at the end of the day. Robert and myself are co-parenting the best we can and it's all love and positivity,"&nbsp;she told the outlet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtnaINzhY6bo5qbXZi1urrAZqKinKNivbC%2F02aqqJuZlrluucSdoJplopa%2FprjYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
