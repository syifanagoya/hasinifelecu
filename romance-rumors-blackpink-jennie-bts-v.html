In December 2021, when BTS members got public Instagram accounts for the first time, fans were taken by surprise when V followed Jennie, making the Blackpink star the only non-BTS member in his following list. Shortly after, the "Dynamite" singer took to the fan platform Weverse to ask fans how to remove the "recommended" feature on Instagram. "Is there a way to get rid of the 'recommended' friends list here on this Insta thing?.... It's a scary app," he wrote in Korean, as noted by&nbsp;<a href=#>All Kpop</a>, seemingly insinuating that the follow was not intentional.</p><p>Dating rumors between the two died down shortly after, but come May 2022, photos of them together began popping up online from an unidentified source, igniting the speculation once more. As pointed out by the&nbsp;<a href=#>South China Morning Post</a>, pictures of the rumored couple going on vacation and hanging out at what appeared to be each other's homes made rounds on the internet, leading many to believe that they were more than just friends. Then again, since none of the photos circulating came from V and Jennie themselves, fans also questioned their authenticity. Others wondered if the images had been lifted from their private accounts without consent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampoaoR4g46rpqaZnpiybr7Upqarq12XuaKvyqmgp6Ndn7KvusieZJuso2LDcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
