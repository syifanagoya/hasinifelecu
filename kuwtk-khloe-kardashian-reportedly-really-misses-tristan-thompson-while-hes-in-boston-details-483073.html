As fans know, the reality TV celeb has been home in L.A. with their daughter, True while he plays for the Boston Celtics.</p><p>Obviously, having him a six hour plane ride away is not ideal but Khloe has been trying her best to be supportive.</p><p>The source tells HollywoodLife that ‘Khloe has been wanting to spend more time with Tristan lately but he has not had the time to be with her or True. It has been harder to co-parent because of the NBA season and they have all had little time together.’</p><p>And the sheer distance is not the only obstacle in their way.</p><p>You might be aware that the NBA has also imposed pretty strict quarantine rules for its players because of the pandemic.</p><p>During the newest episode of <strong>KUWTK</strong>, Khloe stressed that she and Tristan are not back ‘together romantically.’</p><p>Despite this, they still have a very close relationship while co-parenting their child.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘Khloe has been missing him and she is finding with Tristan this far away, she has been having a harder time than before, even in Cleveland. They have had barely any time together as of recent and she is hopeful that will change soon. Tristan checks in as much as possible on FaceTime and calling, but he is very focused and busy and Khloe does get that. She’s been pretty down and her friends have been worried because they have not seen her be like this with him away before. She is looking forward to the NBA season over and them all reuniting again,’ the source told the same news outlet.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsS1t4ykn6WnlWK4or7DmqqhoZGjerOxz6iprZ2UocZuvsSao6WxXaK2tL%2FErGStqpmowaK6jK2fqKWgqLyvedahoKWdXZ2ytHnIp2Sbp6OpvK95w56rmqGcqHp1hJJpbmxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
