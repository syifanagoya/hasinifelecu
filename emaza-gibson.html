When she refused his advances, he allegedly made disturbing references to drug-related activities. It is also alleged that Derulo became aggressive and yelled at Gibson when she rejected him, which eventually led to her being dropped from Atlantic Records in September 2022.</p><p>The lawsuit also mentions Gibson’s interactions with another woman who suggested that she was invited solely because Derulo wanted a s*xual relationship.
