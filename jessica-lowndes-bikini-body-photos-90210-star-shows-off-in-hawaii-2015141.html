Former 90210 star <strong>Jessica Lowndes</strong> is catching a tan — and attention — during her current getaway in sunny Hawaii. The actress has been sharing several photos of her sexy bikini body (and bum!) via Instagram this week.</p><p>Her picture-perfect vacation began on Jan. 6, and has so far consisted of a boat excursion, poolside fun, and paddleboarding. "Making love to the sun #hawaii," she captioned a bikini selfie on Monday, Jan. 12. A few days earlier, the fresh-faced star also shared what appeared to be a topless pic. "Beach bum," she wrote.</p><p>After laying out near the ocean, Lowndes, 26, made her way to the pool. "Feeling refreshed #nofilter," she captioned. Adding in another: "Never want to leave. #heaven." In one particular shot, she rested on her stomach across a surfboard in the water, showing off her slim frame and derriere. "Magic," she wrote.</p><p>In between eating healthy snacks like yogurt and lounging in her hotel bed, Lowndes also spent time with music producer <strong>Shawn Pimental</strong>, Teen Wolf's <strong>Arden Cho</strong>, and Saturday Night Live legend <strong>Jon Lovitz</strong>(!). "Laughing til your stomach hurts… The best!" she captioned a pic of the foursome.</p><p><a href=#>Magic ?????????</a></p><p>A photo posted by Jessica Lowndes (@jessicalowndes) on Jan 13, 2015 at 7:14pm PST</p><p>Back in September 2013, the Vancouver, Canada native, best known for playing Adrianna Tate-Duncan on The CW's 90210 from 2008 to 2013, opened up about her workout regimen. "If I'm in L.A. and have time, I love going to the gym and I work with different trainers, so it's something I've just picked up. But a lot of the time I'm on location or living out of a suitcase, so I don't have time to go the gym. So basically all I do is sit-ups, push-ups, and jumping jacks (or star-jumps as you call them!), lunges and the plank, and you repeat it five times," she told <a href=#>Cosmopolitan UK </a>magazine.</p><p>"I live a healthy lifestyle and I crave healthy food," she added of her eating habits. "I love porridge, I have bizarre cravings for it. I love it with brown sugar and bananas, and I'm a huge fan of cinnamon — I put cinnamon on everything. I also have a sweet tooth and I don't like to deprive myself. I think everything in moderation is the key."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnaOotqStjKWmsKaUmsBursikoKehXZe8pcWMqZ%2BorJ%2Boenp8kWpnZquklr9uv8eorqxln5uzbrXNZp%2Bar5Getm5%2Bj2psamxhZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
