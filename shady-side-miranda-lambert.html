Keep in mind, Brooks had previously performed 12 shows in 10 days (yes, you read that right) before the CMAs. He&nbsp;<a href=#>told press backstage</a> that his voice "wasn't there anymore" at showtime, and they did a "game-day call" on whether to cancel, sing, or lip-sync.</p><p>That wasn't good enough for Lambert's then-beau, Anderson East, who <a href=#>wrote on Instagram</a>: "I keep a lot of my opinions to myself and respect anyone making music but as a person who tries to put on the best and most honest show I can night after night... this truly offends me. I was told country music is three chords and the truth."</p><p>Lambert chimed in, too: "High five on this babe. If you can't sing then don't. It's better to be honest than to pretend. I think it's bulls**t. My favorite performances were live live. The truth."</p><p>While honesty is good, Lambert's comments must have felt like a slap in the face to Brooks, who had previously given her a sweet shout-out backstage, telling press: "Let me tell you who fought the good fight tonight, in my opinion. Miranda Lambert. She is one of the few females that we play, so you think she'd want to play it safe. She stuck country music in all of our faces tonight. Traditional country music. So she's fighting the good fight."&nbsp;</p><p>That adds an extra layer of "ouch" to Lambert and East's needless commentary on Brooks' showmanship, don't you think?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphZn13e9KhmJ2xXai2pbGMpqCrmZ6Zrm64wKaZnqqkZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
