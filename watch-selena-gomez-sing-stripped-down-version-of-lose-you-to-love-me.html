They <a href=#>ended things for good in May 2018</a> and Justin <a href=#>moved on</a> with his now-wife, <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a> (née Baldwin), that June.</p><a title=@selenagomez href=#>@selenagomez</a><p>This isnt the greatest i know so i hope no one minds me turning the comments off for my head but this was the best, most sincere moments with lose you to love me</p><p><a title="♬ original sound - Selena Gomez" href=#>♬ original sound – Selena Gomez</a></p><p>“The song was inspired by Selena’s breakup from Justin, but it would be incorrect to say it’s totally about Justin,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in October 2019. “It’s actually about finally being able to love yourself and moving on from a toxic relationship.”</p><p>The track earned Gomez praise from not only fans but <a href=#>her celebrity friends</a>. “This song is a perfect expression of healing and my absolute favorite song she’s put out yet,” Gomez’s BFF <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> wrote via her Instagram Story in October 2019. “A triumph. I love you so much @selenagomez.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a> — whom Gomez was <a href=#>romantically linked to in the past</a> — also praised the former Disney Channel star by commenting two heart emojis on Gomez’s Instagram post about the song.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gomez opened up about the writing process behind the song in her 2022 Apple TV+ documentary, <a href=#>My Mind & Me</a>. “I texted <a href=#><strong>Julia Michaels</strong></a> and <strong>Justin Tranter</strong> and said, ‘I think I’m ready to just say I’m sad.’ … The fastest song I’ve ever written. It’s about more than just a lost love. It’s me learning to choose myself, to choose life, but also hoping that people can find grace and peace in that too,” she shared. “The song is about knowing that you completely lost every part of who you are just to rediscover yourself again.”</p><p>She continued: “I feel haunted by a past relationship that no one wanted to let go of, but then I just moved past it. And I wasn’t afraid anymore. I feel like I had to go through the worst possible heartbreak ever, and then, just forgetting everything at the drop of a hand, it was really confusing. But I just think that needed to happen. And ultimately, it was the best thing that ever happened to me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6arJOderSxy56lmmWXpLqmxoysoKefXajBs7XPqZydZZSkxK951Z6prKGfo3qwsoylpqydXa68tnnTqGSlp6aaeq6xjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
