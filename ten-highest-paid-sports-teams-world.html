Five are soccer teams, and only one MLB team is represented (the Detroit Tigers).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Just dissecting the top ten franchises, seven NBA teams have the highest payrolls. Here's a look at how the top ten shakes out:</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240447 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-652267990.jpg alt width=900 height=666 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-240447 class=wp-caption-text>Streeter Lecka/Getty Images</p><p><b>10. New Orleans Pelicans – $7.88 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite a promising 2014-15 season led to a playoff berth, the Pelicans have struggled tremendously over the past several seasons. <a href=# title="Jrue Holiday Net Worth">Jrue Holiday</a>, who's making $24.9 million this year, is being paid like a max player, but so far, he hasn't performed like one. On his own team, he's been outplayed by <a href=# rel=noopener>Anthony Davis</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>DeMarcus Cousins</a>.</span></p><p><b>9. Real Madrid – $8.09 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Led by <a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and his $24.3 million salary, Real Madrid became the first club ever to win back-to-back Champions League titles with a second championship in 2017. Domestically, Real Madrid has won 33 La Liga titles, so you could say this is money well spent.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240450 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-880659444.jpg alt width=900 height=724 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-240450 class=wp-caption-text>Harry How/Getty Images</p><p><b>8. Los Angeles Clippers – $8.33 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even with <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Paul</a> leaving for the Houston Rockets, the Clippers still have a high bankroll. <a href=# rel=noopener>Blake Griffin</a> just signed a max extension this off season, so he'll take home $29.5 million this year. Though the Clippers started 4-0 this season, they've been inconsistent since. Can they regain their footing in a tough Western Conference?</span></p><p><b>7. Portland Trail Blazers – $8.36 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>Damian Lillard</a>'s $26.2 million leads the way, though <a href=# title="C.J. McCollum Net Worth">C.J. McCollum</a> and his $23.9 million aren't far behind. Together, the duo forms one of the toughest backcourts in the league. And while they haven't yet helped the team return to the Western Conference Finals, they're still among one of the most exciting teams in the NBA.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240449 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-879141114.jpg alt width=900 height=760 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-240449 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images</p><p><b>6. Charlotte Hornets – $8.38 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Hornets are the latest team to try and resurrect <a href=# title="Dwight Howard Net Worth">Dwight Howard's</a> career. Howard will make $23.5 million this year but his Player Efficiency Rating and Win Shares are among the worst he's ever posted.</span></p><p><b>5. Paris Saint-Germain – $8.41 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>At a whopping $37.2 million, nobody has a higher salary than <a href=# rel=noopener>Neymar</a>. As a result, Paris Saint-Germain now has the fifth-highest payroll after ranking just 35th in all of sports last year.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240451 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-881178962.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-240451 class=wp-caption-text>David Ramos/Getty Images</p><p><b>4. Barcelona – $8.58 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Real Madrid's main rival, FC Barcelona is led by <a href=# rel=noopener>Lionel Messi</a>, who will make $34.7 million this season. And though Real Madrid has had the championship glory the past few seasons, FC Barcelona is no stranger to success. The club has won 24 La Liga and 29 Copa del Rey trophies.</span></p><p><b>3. Golden State Warriors – $8.94 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>Steph Curry</a>'s last contract was worth $44 million over four years. He'll make close to that this season alone after signing a max deal this off season. Curry will make $34.7 million, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kevin Durant</a> will take home $25 million, and three other players will earn at least $14.8 million. But hey, it's hard to argue with three straight trips to the NBA Finals and two championship rings.</span></p><p><b>2. Cleveland Cavaliers – $9 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The other team that's made the NBA Finals three years in a row, the Cavaliers are led by <a href=# rel=noopener>LeBron James</a>, who will make $33.3 million this season. Of course, the big question all year will be whether LeBron leaves as a free agent this off season. If he does, the Cavs payroll will drop tremendously.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240448 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-859964058.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-240448 class=wp-caption-text>J Pat Carter/Getty Images</p><p><b>1. Oklahoma City Thunder – $9.30 million per player</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The latest super team in Oklahoma City has been decidedly less than super this season. <a href=# title="Russell Westbrook Net Worth">Russell Westbrook</a> is making $28.5 million to lead the way, but <a href=# rel=noopener>Carmelo Anthony</a> ($26.2 million), <a href=# title="Steven Adams Net Worth">Steven Adams</a> ($22.4 million), and <a href=# rel=noopener>Paul George</a> ($19.5 million) are all getting paid big bucks, too.
