While there may not be a definitive meaning behind the song, there are certainly several themes and motifs that are present. In this article, we’ll explore some of the most common interpretations of “30 for 30 (Freestyle)” and what they may mean.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Basic_Premise></span>The Basic Premise<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before we dive into the meaning behind “30 for 30,” let’s first establish what the song is actually about. In general, the lyrics of the song are focused on Drake and Future’s experiences in the music industry, particularly as they relate to their financial success.</p><p>The title of the song, “30 for 30,” refers to a 30 for 30 deal, which is a type of record contract. In a 30 for 30 deal, a rapper agrees to turn over 30% of their income to the record label in exchange for a certain level of support and promotion. Many artists have spoken out against these types of deals, claiming that they can be exploitative and unfair.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at some of the themes and motifs that appear in “30 for 30 (Freestyle).”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Search_for_Success></span>The Search for Success<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the most prominent themes in “30 for 30” is the idea that success is elusive and difficult to obtain. Throughout the song, Drake and Future make references to their hard work and dedication to their craft, but also acknowledge that they have faced setbacks and challenges along the way.</p><p>For example, in the opening lines of the song, Drake raps, “Never thought that it’d be like this/From a small city that I won’t forget/One second it’s all yours, then suddenly it slips.” This suggests that Drake is grappling with the fact that his success can be fleeting and unpredictable.</p><p>Similarly, Future touches on this theme in his verse, rapping, “I’m the only one that get the job done/I don’t know a nigga that could cover for me.” This suggests that Future is aware that he is in a unique position as a successful rapper, and that he works hard to maintain that status.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Cost_of_Fame></span>The Cost of Fame<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another theme that is present in “30 for 30” is the cost of fame. Throughout the song, both Drake and Future make reference to the ways in which their fame and success have changed them, and the sacrifices they have had to make along the way.</p><p>For example, Drake raps, “I gotta move smarter, gotta move harder,” suggesting that he has to constantly be aware of the consequences of his actions as a public figure. He also makes reference to the fact that he can no longer trust people the way he used to: “They’ll be back when they need something, swear they’re someone else/Bein’ humble don’t work as well as bein’ aware.” This suggests that Drake has learned to be cautious in his dealings with others because of his fame.</p><p>Similarly, Future raps, “Ever since I got it, I’ve been the same nigga they seen/Imitated but never duplicated,” suggesting that his fame has made him a target for criticism and imitation. He also references the ways in which he has had to change his lifestyle to fit into the world of celebrity: “Bitches changin’ their style, they wanna have sex now.” This suggests that Future has had to navigate the complexities of fame in order to maintain his success.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Importance_of_Loyalty></span>The Importance of Loyalty<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another prominent motif in “30 for 30” is the idea of loyalty. Throughout the song, both Drake and Future make reference to the fact that they value loyalty above all else, and that they have had to be careful about whom they trust in the music industry.</p><p>For example, Drake raps, “Everybody that’s married is miserable/I know that it’s true ’cause I’m single, not tryna be different.” This suggests that Drake values his independence and his ability to be true to himself, rather than conforming to the expectations and standards set by others in the industry.</p><p>Similarly, Future raps, “Goin’ in, I ain’t never had a job still/But my rent due and my kids need meals/And they wanna see a nigga fall off,” suggesting that he is constantly aware of the ways in which people may try to bring him down. However, he also asserts his loyalty to his friends and family, rapping, “But I can’t allow myself to take a loss, I’m the boss/Overdo it, I’ma overdo it on the sauce.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Role_of_Money></span>The Role of Money<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Finally, “30 for 30” explores the ways in which money plays a role in the music industry. While rappers often flaunt their wealth in their lyrics, “30 for 30” takes a more nuanced approach, suggesting that money can be both a blessing and a curse.</p><p>For example, Drake raps, “I got a price on my head but there’s a risk to collect it,” suggesting that his wealth has put him in a vulnerable position. He also acknowledges that money can’t solve all of his problems: “All of this disorder, no addressin’/The crown is broken in pieces, but there’s more in my possession.”</p><p>Similarly, Future touches on the theme of money in his verse, rapping, “I done went got a Rollie, a whole lotta cash/And I still ain’t got no peace, ain’t nothin’ changed.” This suggests that despite his financial success, Future is still grappling with the same issues that he faced before he became famous.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQs></span>FAQs:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_What_is_a_30_for_30_deal></span>1.
