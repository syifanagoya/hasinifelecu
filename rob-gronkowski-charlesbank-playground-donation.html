The donation was made possible by the funds raised during the Boston Maraton and were delivered on behalf of the Gronk Nation Youth Foundation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How NFL Quarterback Patrick Mahomes Spent His Half A Billion Dollars</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This generous act of philanthropy</a> will go towards stripping down the playground's old swing sets and jungle gyms to then be replaced with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more modern, safe equipment</a>. The proceeds will also create a new 10 year maintenance fund to ensure&nbsp;Charlesbank is always at tip top shape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The announcement of the donation was made during a press conference with Gronkowski, the city's governor Charlie Baker, and&nbsp;Michael Nichols - the executive director of&nbsp;Esplanade Association who says the donation will turn Charlesbank into a "super fun place for children to learn, grow, exercise, and play."</p><p>"The Patriots taught me the importance of giving back from the very first day I stepped in that organization," the athlete proclaims during the conference, "A huge shout out to Mr. Kraft and the Patriots for instilling that into me and showing me the importance of what it's like to give back"</p><p>Gov. Baker was elated by this donation, offering up kind words about the athlete and his family: "They give back time and time again and they especially give back to the youngest, most vulnerable and frailest among us, our children"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Rob Gronkowski is a lot of things," the governor goes on to say, "but the thing I think that gets lost sometimes amidst all the other things that everybody thinks and knows about him, [is that] he's a big man with a big heart."</p><p>Gronkowski is no stranger to giving back. From his 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">live-stream competition with Shaquille O'Neal</a> in efforts to raise money for the NAACP to teaming up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Honey Nut Cheerios</a>&nbsp;to give back through his youth foundation, this big guy has always had a knack for philanthropy.&nbsp;Because of this highly laudable act, there's talks of changing the park's name in his honor.</p><p>In an email to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston.com</a>, Nicholas discloses that Esplanade Association will commence the design phase for the park in the following week.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next: <span class=related-single><a href=#>The Weeknd Partners With World Food Program USA, Donates $1M To Help Ethiopians</a></span></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Press Herald</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriots</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2FsK6MoKmoppukxLS3yGaaoZmiobK0rsCnomaonJbGqL7OrqWdZZSku6LAyKilaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
