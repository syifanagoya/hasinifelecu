But the one at 1080 Meadow Lane in <a href=#>Southampton</a> is a cut above even its high-price surroundings: It's been on the market for about two years now, and during that time has always had the same asking price: $150 million.</p><p>The second-most expensive property currently for sale in the area? That would be another Meadow Lane property which is listed at just under $54 million â€“ almost $100 million less than the more expensive one! As for 1080 Meadow Lane, it sprawls across almost 14 acres and offers 700 feet of oceanfront, itself spread across three different lots on the property. The estate's main house is a 12,000-square-foot behemoth with 12 bedrooms and 12+ baths, and is described like so in its official real estate listing:</p><p><strong>"With 360-degree water views, the world-class trophy location includes a 12,000+/- s.f. main residence with indoor pool and surfeit of glass for the extraordinary views, a tennis court with tennis house, pool & spa with pool house, two golf greens with golf houses. From any of the three private walkways to the ocean, the views up and down the Atlantic, in addition to the unobstructed view across the bay will take your breath away."</strong></p><p>It would seem that even a jewel like this doesn't find a buyer right away, at least at $150 million, but with its golf greens, pool, tennis court, and a host of amenities it's hard to imagine it going for a much lower price either.</p><p>For your part, even if you don't have $150 million to spend on a luxurious beachfront property in the Hamptons, all you need is a decent internet connection to take a quick tour of the area's most expensive real estate listing by watching the video below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmraCZqHpygY9mpKKknJ68r3nPq6apnaKpxm610maroZ1dory0wIyer6mdnqi2t7GMn6arZaOWuaZ5yKdkraCVYrWiuc%2BtpqerXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
