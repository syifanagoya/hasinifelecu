Betty said in an interview: “He promised me the moon. The guy asked me to marry him every day for three years.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The couple married in a lavish ceremony in 1969. Betty no longer had to struggle and save for her family, as she sat at home and raised the couple's four children while enjoying their growing fortune and the opulent lifestyle.&nbsp; However, the marriage would soon begin to fall apart.</p><p>When Betty found he had been having an affair with his legal secretary Linda Kolkena, the schism between them further widened. Betty said Dan, a prominent lawyer at the time, was abusing his "legal influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual income" during their divorce battle. Additionally, Betty's defense attorneys also claimed that she was subjected to mental torture by Dan.</p><p>"He took my home, my kids, my money," Betty said in an interview in 1991. "His was the white-collar way of beating you. If he had hit me with a baseball bat, I could have shown people what he did and made him stop." Betty then took her daughter's key to Dan's house on November 5, 1989, crept through, and shot her ex-husband and his new wife as they slept in their bed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Betty stated she only intended to approach Dan and Linda and kill herself. "It made sense to me: Taking the gun to make them listen to me," Betty told Oprah in 1992. Much of the country was both shocked and outraged by the incident. Betty was portrayed by some as a cold-blooded killer, whereas others disagreed and sympathized with her allegations of Dan's abusive behavior.</p><p>Much of the country was both outraged and angered by the case. Betty was portrayed by some as a cold-blooded murderer, while others doubted and sympathised with her allegations of psychological torture. Betty blamed her behaviour on the divorce and didn't change her story of what transpired that night when a similar disagreement arose in 2010.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Linda came at me and the gun went off." (She insisted throughout her prosecutions that the murders were not planned while admitting to ripping the Brodericks' phone out of the wall so Daniel could not call for help.) Betty has never denied firing the gun, but she has claimed that she committed the double homicide after experiencing significant emotional and psychological abuse throughout her 16-year marriage's painful divorce.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 id=is_betty_broderick_still_in_prison class=smooth-goto>Is Betty Broderick Still in Prison?</h2><p>Betty Broderick has been in prison for 30 years after being found guilty of murdering her ex-husband and his new bride in their bedroom.

In 1991, Betty was convicted to 32 years to life in prison for the murders of her ex-husband Dan Broderick, 44, a well-known San Diego lawyer, and his wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, 28.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Deputy District Attorney Richard Sachs, who was present at the hearing, argued against parole and described his reasoning. "Betty Broderick is an unrepentant woman," he said. "She has no remorse and zero insight into the killings…She just basically said 'they drove me to do this.'"</p><p>Betty's sentencing took place about 30 years ago. At 73 years old, Betty is still alive and confined at the California Institution for Women in Chino, California.She is anticipated to be imprisoned for the rest of her life.</p><p class=trending-main-title>TRENDING</p><a href=# aria-label="Only a genius can Spot the 3 differences"><img alt="Only a genius can Spot the 3 differences" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/02/spot-the-difference-picture-puzzle-game-only-a-genius-with-hawk-eyes-can-find-the-3-diffe-65deb6ee8657433697461-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today"><img alt="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/crossword/2023/02/crossword-clue-home-1076100520-300.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only geniuses can find the 4 mistakes"><img alt="Only geniuses can find the 4 mistakes" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/02/picture-puzzle-iq-test-only-top-1-with-high-intelligence-can-spot-the-4-mistakes-inside-65dd86706186673502648-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!"><img alt="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/02/brain-teaser-spot-the-difference-game-only-people-with-sharp-eyes-can-spot-2-differences-65d828d24ed4932993717-1200.webp></a><h2 id=did_betty_broderick_get_parole class=smooth-goto>Did Betty Broderick get Parole?</h2><p>Betty is still behind bars, charged with second-degree murder. In 1991, she was sentenced to 32 years to life in prison, including two 15-year terms for the murders. She is currently incarcerated at the California Institution for Women, where she has been rejected parole twice: once in 2010 and again in 2017.&nbsp;The court refused her parole for the maximum period (15 years), which means she would be eligible for re-eligibility in 2032. She might be allowed sooner if she meets specific criteria, such as good behaviour.&nbsp;The parole board in California unanimously decided to oppose her release. Therefore, she'll be 84 years old when she's up for parole again in 2032.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 id=what_happened_to_betty_broderick_children class=smooth-goto>What happened to Betty Broderick Children?</h2><p><strong><span class=picture_container><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/02/spot-the-difference-picture-puzzle-game-only-a-genius-with-hawk-eyes-can-find-the-3-diffe-65deb6ee8657433697461-1200.webp></span></strong></p><p>Image Source: Plejada</p><p>Betty Broderick's three children are now married and have children of their own.
