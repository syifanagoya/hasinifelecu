If that wasn't impressive enough, the couple are surrounded by the who's who of Hollywood. While they may not be able to socialise with their famous neighbours just yet due to the coronavirus lockdown, the couple certainly have some fabulous people to mingle with in their gated community once life starts to return to 'normal'.

So while he may not be home all the time, he is already close friends with Meghan and Harry, which will make 'meeting the neighbours' that much easier. Elton's 24,260 square feet of property boasts ten bedrooms, 22 bathrooms and three stories of luxury living space. There is a screening room, wine cellar, game room, a gym and a swimming pool! There's also said to be a lift in the home so he and his family can go from floor to floor with ease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7740e6301b7c-jennifer-lawrence-home-a.jpg><h2>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p id=egYaOUZSrQUZ>Oscar-winning actress <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> may split her time between New York and LA, but when she's back on the West Coast, she calls her £6.5million property, home. Previous owners include Jessica Simpson and Ellen DeGeneres. The five-bedroom house features a gourmet kitchen, sprawling staircase, elegant living room and five-and-a-half bathrooms. There's also an envy-inducing walk-in wardrobe and home makeup and hair station!

The driveway and front of the house are shaded by beautiful trees and greenery which give the couple even more privacy. There's also said to be off-street parking for up to 20 cars on her driveway! Of course, the garden is just as impressive as the spacious interior, with a double-edged infinity pool and spectacular views of the canyon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b14e54cc8ac1-rod-stewart-home-a.jpg><h2>Sir Rod Stewart and Penny Lancaster</h2><p id=eAOwoAOqBJrgG><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Rod Stewart</a> </strong>and his wife <a class=hm-link href=#>Penny Lancaster</a>'s LA abode was designed with an English stately home in mind.

The living room features a 200-year-old French crystal chandelier, there is a library with an impressive Louis XV desk and a small panelled family room off the kitchen that is referred to as the tearoom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed0d44c1d63c-nicole-kidman-home-a.jpg><h2>Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban</h2><p id=eg0bNf-yxRwy0><a class=hm-link href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> and country singer <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Keith Urban</a></strong> have an impressive property portfolio, owning homes in Australia and Nashville, Tennessee.
