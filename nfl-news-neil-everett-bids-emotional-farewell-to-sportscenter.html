The decision comes after it was rumored that ESPN had offered him a lower salary compared to previous years.</p><p>Everett joined ESPN in 2000 and became an integral part of the network’s Los Angeles Sports Center.&nbsp;He dominated the scene alongside longtime colleague<strong> Stan Verrett.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The 61-year-old Neil Everett said this about his exit: “ESPN changed my life, but now it’s time for me to change my life. Time to write a new chapter.”&nbsp;After such a long career with the channel, he believes that it’s time to call it quits.</p><p>Everett bid his goodbyes to his audience. He mentioned all the love he has garnered over the years from everyone and from the fans on social media. Even though Everett himself is not on Twitter, he spoke about a tweet that he found rather funny.&nbsp;“I have been watching SportsCenter religiously for 20+ years, and I’ve never heard of Neil Everett,” the&nbsp;tweet read, according to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Love is a long road.

We joined up for sportscenter from LA in 2009. For 14 years, he was the best teammate I could imagine. Selfless, caring, generous, and a pro’s pro. He’s moving on now, but we are brothers for life. That’ll never change.</p>— stan verrett (@stanverrett) <a href=#>June 8, 2023</a></figure><p>Everett’s departure from ESPN reminds us of <strong>Kenny Mayne</strong>‘s contract situation in 2021. But Verrett can breathe a sigh of relief because this won’t be an issue for him.</p><p>Besides Everett, ESPN also let go of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the NHL</a> announcer <strong>Chris Chelios.</strong> It is possible fans will see more of the cast get cut in the coming months. This is due to ESPN’s owner Bob Iger slashing the cost to $5.5 billion and the number of employees 7000 worldwide.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deion Sanders set to undergo emergency surgery to remove two blood clots from his legs</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-fans-ever-see-neil-everett-again>Will fans ever see Neil Everett again?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Neil-Everett-SI-1140x815-1-1024x732.jpg><p>While we may not see Everett on ESPN, if he shares his expertise, you might find him elsewhere.
