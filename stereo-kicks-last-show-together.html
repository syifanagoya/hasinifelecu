Their first performance together on the show was a cover of ‘Run’ which they sang mostly individually, still finding their harmonises together, only singing as a group at the end. It truly was the start of something magical.</p><p>Their last performance together on the show was also that song, by this point they had found their harmonies together and sung it beautifully. Their voices perfectly combining to make the song even more breathtaking even without all the memories it holds for the boys.</p><p>Their history with the song makes the fact that it was the last song the boys sang together at Thorpe Park even more emotional. The tears weren’t just falling from the fan’s eyes that went to see the boys preform for the last time ever, but the boys were also crying too. The whole night was emotional and heartbreaking as the boys played together for the last time ever.</p><p>It’s been almost a year since the band got put together, and in that time they’ve achieved so much including releasing their debut single ‘Love Me So’ which charted at number 31 on the UK Singles Chart and was also the number-one physical single. In that time they’ve also gained the hearts of thousands of fans, all of which broke on Saturday.</p><p>But all good things have to come to an end, and it’s time to say goodbye to Stereo Kicks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kwLWx0Z6mZqOZmLi0ecuaqq1lo528uHnTqJ6erJiav3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
