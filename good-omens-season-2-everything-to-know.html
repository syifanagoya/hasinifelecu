The Prime Video hit, which follows angel Aziraphale (<a href=#><strong>Michael Sheen</strong></a>) and his best friend, a demon named Crowley (<a href=#><strong>David Tennant</strong></a>), as they attempt to prevent Armageddon,&nbsp;is based on<a href=#> <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong> and Terry Pratchett’s 1990 novel</a> of the same name.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>After critical praise — and a mini episode titled Good Omens: Lockdown<a href=#> during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> in 2020 — the streamer surprised fans when it announced the show would be returning for a second season, featuring an entirely new story for the unlikely duo.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Neil always talked about the idea that he and Terry [Pratchett] had talked quite a bit about future storylines and that they had worked out quite a lot of it, actually. They just never got around to writing it down in a book,” Sheen told <a href=#>Collider </a>in July 2023. “So there was quite a lot of material already in his head. One of the wonderful things about this, as well, working on this project, has been how much myself and David have been able to collaborate with Neil on the characters and inhabit them and bring them to life, and developing the relationship between them and the storylines. So it’s felt very collaborative, but then, of course, Neil is very good at making it feel collaborative even when he knows exactly what he wants.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Keep scrolling for everything to know about Good Omens season 2:&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span class=x_ContentPasted0>When Does ‘Good Omens’ Season 2 Premiere?</span></b></h3><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The <a href=#>first episode of season 2 will premiere</a> on Prime Video Friday, July 28, and have a weekly release schedule.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span class=x_ContentPasted0>How Many Episodes Are in ‘Good Omens’ Season 2?</span></b></h3><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Season 2 will be comprised of six episodes.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Who Is the Cast of ‘Good Omens’ Season 2?</span></b><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Sheen and Tennant will return as Aziraphale and Crowley, respectively, with <a href=#><strong>Jon Hamm</strong></a> reprising his role as Gabriel and <strong>Derek Jacobi</strong> appearing as Metatron. <strong>Nina Sosanya</strong> and<strong> Maggie Service</strong>, for their parts, will be playing different characters than their season 1 counterparts. <strong>Liz Carr, Doon Mackichan, Gloria Obianyo</strong>, and <strong>Miranda Richardson</strong> will also make appearances in new roles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0><strong>Shelley Conn, Tim Downie, Pete Firman, Alex Norton, Andi Osho, Dame Siân Phillips</strong> and <strong>Quelin Sepulveda</strong> are new additions to the cast, while<a href=#><strong> Benedict Cumberbatch</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Frances McDormand</strong></a> and <strong>Adria Arjona</strong> are among the notable absences.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Everything-to-Know-About-the-Good-Omens-Unexpected-2nd-Season-Plot-Details-Cast-and-More-466.jpg><h3><b><span class=x_ContentPasted0>What Is Season 2 of ‘Good Omens’ About?</span></b></h3><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While season 1 of Good Omens followed the narrative of Gaiman and Pratchett’s novel of the same name, season 2 will be a completely new story. After season 2 was announced in July 2021, Gaiman put old ideas he and Pratchett didn’t include in their novel and used them for season 2 of the adaption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Terry’s not here any longer, but when he was, we had talked about what we wanted to do with Good Omens, and where the story went next,” Gaiman said in a press release at the time. “And now, thanks to BBC Studios and Amazon, I get to take it there. I have enlisted some wonderful collaborators, and <strong>John Finnemore</strong> has come on board to carry the torch with me. There are so many questions people have asked about what happened next (and also, what happened before) to our favorite Angel and Demon. Here are the answers you’ve been hoping for. We are back in Soho, and all through time and space, solving a mystery, which starts with an angel wandering through Soho, with no memory.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3><b><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Is There a Trailer for ‘Good Omens’ Season 2?</span></b></h3><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Prime Video released the first teaser,<a href=#> which you can watch above</a>, for season 2 in June, revealing that the central mystery will revolve around angel Gabriel.
