In one TikTok video captured by another concertgoer, the couple were <a href=#>spotted making out</a> in their VIP seats as Drake, 36, performed “God’s Plan.”</p><p>In another video, Kardashian, 42, <a href=#>snapped pics</a> while her younger sister swayed to the music with Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio. The group was later joined by <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>’s ex <a href=#><strong>Tristan Thompson</strong></a>.</p><p>Another clip showed Bad Bunny <a href=#>putting his arm around</a> Jenner’s waist as they danced. At one point, she leaned in to say something to her boyfriend, who then gave her a kiss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kendall-Jenner-and-Bad-Bunny-Make-Out-at-Drake-Concert.jpg><p>Jenner and Bad Bunny have been <a href=#>linked since February</a>, but some fans were still surprised to see them being so affectionate in public. “Kim obsessing over Kendall and Benito is me 😭😍,” tweeted one social media user. Another joked that Bad Bunny has a unique effect on Jenner, who rarely engages in PDA. “Kendall? being touchy with a man in public? Benito the man that you are,” joked the Twitter user.</p><p>In June, Bad Bunny explained that he’s reluctant to share details about his dating life because it’s one of the few things he’s still able to keep himself as a globally popular celebrity. “I know something is going to come out,” <a href=#>he told Rolling Stone</a>. “I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what’s left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.”</p><p>When directly asked whether he wanted to clarify his relationship status with Jenner, he replied: “That’s the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One month earlier, however, the Grammy winner hinted that <a href=#>he was in a happy place</a>, although he didn’t specify what had him in such a good mood. “I just enjoy my life right now,” he told Apple Music 1’s <strong>Zane Lowe</strong> in May. “[I] do what I feel. What’s next? I don’t know. I’m just enjoying my life right now, I’m just living and breathing.”</p><p>Earlier this year, an insider exclusively told Us Weekly that Jenner <a href=#>sees “long-term potential”</a> with Bad Bunny. “She feels like he’s the complete package and he treats her like a total gentleman,” the source said in May. “They are having a great time together, and she appreciates that he gets along with all of her friends. They complement each other on so many levels and she’s enjoying getting to know him better every day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZ6Zrq24jKOcp6aVp3qiusNmmZqcXZfCr7rYZqSao5VivLbAjJqrZpyilrimecKopZydoql8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
